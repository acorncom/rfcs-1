# Summary

Doing something similar to what Yeoman does would be awesome.

![from yeoman](http://yeoman.io/assets/img/codelab/image_8.5a17.png)

Basically exposing some of those cli attributes as questions, and being able to add additional addons/settings/files based on user's answers.

Like Less, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, etc..

# Motivation

This would also make addons much more powerful, since they can ask the user critical questions, and not always assume. This would also make ember-cli more powerful, and as we draw closer to a core cli, these features will be more important for wider adoption.

# Detailed design

TODO

# Drawbacks

More API surface area.

# Alternatives

None.

# Unresolved questions

How to do this.
